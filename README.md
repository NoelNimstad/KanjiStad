## 漢字スタッド (KanjiStad / KanjiCity)
An open source kanji drawing practise based on [WaniKani](https://wanikani.com)'s levels, [Kanji Canvas by Dominik Klein](https://github.com/asdfjkl/kanjicanvas) & [KanjiVG](http://kanjivg.tagaini.net/) by Ulrich Apel.

I decided to make the project because I needed something like this, however all alternatives I found were payed, therefore the logical conclusion was to make my own version of it, and thereby I coded up KanjiCity v1 in 3 hours.

## UX
If you are on a mobile device, it is highly reccomended to install the website as a PWA (web app) if possible. On computers, having a drawing tablet is highly reccomended.
